# Music-Listening-WebApp
IIT Madras, B S Degree, Modern Application Development - 1

 As a continuation of the Modern App Dev-1 course theory, this project focuses on creating a
 Song Listening Web Application, inspired by the terminology used in existing music platforms like Saavan,
 Spotify, and Resso. The goal is to apply the technologies covered in the theoretical course to build a robust
 and feature-rich application. This project features user roles (normal user, creator, and admin) having
 respective specific permissions and functions that are explained below

  Technologies used :
 1. Python (for all control over the Application)
 2. Flask-Restful (for API)
 3. Flask-Sqlalchemy (for Managing Database)
 4. Flask-Login (for making secure login and session)
 5. DateTime (for operations on Data Time)
 6. Python os (for managing files and folders)
 7. Matplotlib (for creating Charts)

    

I already created an admin object because in my implementation admin user_id in a negative integer

Admin(user_id=-1,adminname='IITM',admin_mail='admin@iitm.com',admin_pass='Madras')

just start the application by python main.py
