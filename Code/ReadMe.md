Admin(user_id=-1,adminname='IITM',admin_mail='admin@iitm.com',admin_pass='Madras')

just start application by 
python main.py 

this sumission file not having any user/creator/song/album/playlist because the file size restriction on uploading zip file
you have to create every thing from scratch
